    <h1>Welcome to my Page - AKA Emma's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
        <p> <em> Hi! My name is Emma and I'm from Maine. This is my first experience ever using code but so far I've been super interested with how unique the language of it is. <br>
            I am a marine affairs major, but as stated in some of the previous videos for this class, code is prevelant in all sciences and day to day activities, so I'm excited to get familiar with it!</em> <p>
